# Face Detection With VGG Pre-Trained Model
**1. Setup and Dependencies**

- Imports necessary libraries including TensorFlow (tf), OpenCV (cv2), NumPy (np), matplotlib (plt) and JSON.
- Loads the pre-trained face tracker model (`facetracker.keras`) from the specified path.

**2. Data Preparation**

- Defines paths for the training and test image datasets.
- Sets the number of images to use for training (`number_images`).

**3. GPU Memory Allocation**

- Limits the memory usage of the GPU to prevent errors.

**4. Loading and Preprocessing Training Images**

- Creates a TensorFlow Dataset of image file paths.
- Defines a function `load_image` to read and decode images from their paths.
- Applies the `load_image` function to the dataset for image loading.
- Creates another dataset for labels (bounding box coordinates) in JSON format.
- Checks for inconsistencies between image and label files.

**5. Data Augmentation**

- Defines data augmentation functions using the Albumentations library for random cropping, horizontal flipping, brightness/contrast adjustments, and random gamma correction.
- Applies these augmentations to randomly selected training images and their corresponding bounding boxes.

**6. Visualizing Data Augmentation**

- Reads an example image and its corresponding label.
- Crops the image based on the bounding box coordinates.
- Displays the original image and the cropped image side-by-side.
- Shows the augmented image with a bounding box drawn around the detected face.

**7. Processing Training, Validation, and Test Data**

- Iterates through training, validation, and test partitions of the data.
- Loads image and label data for each partition.
- Applies data augmentation to training images only.
- Saves augmented images and labels with unique names.

**8. Creating TensorFlow Datasets**

- Creates TensorFlow Datasets for training, validation, and test images after preprocessing.
- Resizes images to a fixed size (120x120 pixels) for model input.
- Normalizes image pixel values between 0 and 1.

**9. Defining a Custom Loss Function**

- Defines a function `localization_loss` to calculate the loss for bounding box prediction accuracy.
- Combines classification loss (face/not face) and localization loss in the `FaceTracker` model class.

**10. Building the Face Tracker Model**

- Defines a function `build_model` that creates a CNN architecture using a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and additional layers for classification and bounding box regression.

**11. Model Compilation and Training**

- Compiles the `FaceTracker` model with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss for classification, and the custom localization loss.
- Defines a custom training step function (`train_step`) to calculate and apply gradients for both classification and localization loss.
- Fits the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs with validation on the validation data.
- Monitors training progress using TensorBoard.

**12. Model Evaluation**

- Evaluates the model on the test data and displays the loss.
- Visualizes detections on sample test images.

**13. Saving the Model**

- Saves a copy of the trained model to a specified location.

**14. Loading a Pre-Trained Model (Optional)**

- Demonstrates how to load a pre-trained model from a different location (commented out in your code).

**15. Making Predictions on New Images**

- Loads a new dataset of images for prediction (assuming it's prepared similarly to the training data).
- Uses the trained model to predict class probabilities and bounding boxes for the new images.
- Visualizes the predictions on sample images.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to train a face tracker model using TensorFlow, perform data augmentation, define custom loss functions, visualize predictions, and save/load the trained model.
